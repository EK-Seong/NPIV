# NPIV
- Nonparametric Series estimation(linear sieve) is too complicated. I'm not ready to study this topic, yet. However, I need to submit the term paper... Let's just do it.
## File description
### 3-1 Nonparametrics
#### Term paper project
- npiv_averaging_sim.m : the main code for the simulation
- npiv_vulnerability.m : code plotting graphs that show the vulnerability of the NPIV
- Fig2.xlsx : the dataset for the simulation
- n200.mat : and other similar files are the results of the simulation
- n200.fig : and other similar files are the graphs of the results
- vul_NPIV_n200.fig : Other similar files are graphs showing the vulnerability of the NPIV. n=200,K=2.
